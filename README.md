# Elmer/Ice custom solvers and rouutines

### Description

This repository contains the solvers and routines I wrote for Elmer/Ice. In order to be usable, an installtion of Elmer (https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem) is required. Compile with the Elmer wrapper `elmerf90`. 

Note that some of these solvers may need extra libraries usually not linked with Elmer (eg. NetCDF, Parallel-NetCDF).
