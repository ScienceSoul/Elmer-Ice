# Elmer-Ice

### Description

This repository contains the solvers and routines for Elmer/Ice I wrote or contributed code to. In order to be usable, an installation of Elmer (https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem) is required. Compile with the Elmer wrapper `elmerf90`. 

Note that some of these solvers need extra libraries usually not linked with Elmer (eg. NetCDF, Parallel-NetCDF).
